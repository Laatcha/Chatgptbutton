Button to upload files to chat gpt. From: https://www.youtube.com/@automatemylife00
"Generate a Js script that creates a button with the text ‘Submit File’ and inserts it into the DOM before an element with the class ‘.flex.flex-col.w-full.py-2.flex-grow.md\:py-3.md\:pl-4’. The button should have a green background color, white text color, 5px padding, no border, 5px border radius and 5px margin. The script should also create a progress element and insert it into the DOM before the same element. The progress element should have a width of 99%, height of 5px and a grey background color. Inside the progress element, there should be another div element representing the progress bar with a width of 0%, height of 100% and blue background color. When the button is clicked, it should create an input element of type ‘file’ that accepts ‘.txt’, ‘.js’, ‘.py’, ‘.html’, ‘.css’, ‘.json’ and ‘.csv’ files. Once a file is selected,  using an async it should be read as text and split into chunks of size 15000. using async Each chunk should be submitted into a conversation by doing the following:
 async function submitConversation(text, part, filename) {
        const textarea = document.querySelector("textarea[tabindex='0']");
        const enterKeyEvent = new KeyboardEvent("keydown", {
          bubbles: true,
          cancelable: true,
          keyCode: 13,
        });
        textarea.value = `Part ${part} of ${filename}: \n\n ${text}`;
        textarea.dispatchEvent(enterKeyEvent);
      }. 
The progress bar should be updated after each chunk is submitted within the for loop as follows
progressBar.style.width = `${((i + 1) / numChunks) * 100}%`;
 and should also check if chatgpt is ready with this code:
chatgptReady = false;
      while (!chatgptReady) {
        await new Promise((resolve) =＞ setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
        chatgptReady = !document.querySelector(
          ".text-2xl ＞ span:not(.invisible)"
Once all chunks have been submitted, the progress bar should turn blue.
